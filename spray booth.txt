	cheap pleated filters plus a scrub-pad-like prefilter that triples pleat lifespan
	cheap fiberglass furnace filters as paper clogs too rapidly and are too expensive
	scrub-pad-like material to catch lacquer that will otherwise seal paper filters
	one user prefers dedicated spraybooth filters from https://pittsburghsprayequip.com/product-category/spray-booth-filters/?category_id=135
	
https://pittsburghsprayequip.com/product/paint-pocket-paint-booth-filters/
	dedicated paint filters are initial pressure drop of only 0.06"WC but 1.00"WC when fully loaded
	arrest 100% @ 20 um, 99.8% @ 10um, 85% @ 5um, 4% @ 2.5um
	'wave' filters are ideal for water-borne, 0.12"/0.50" pressure drop (initial/final)

https://www.boothfilterstore.com/faq.html
	paint droplets are >7-10 um
	paint arrestors should have the open weave facing into the painting chamber, with skin backing afterward

	paint pigments are 0.1-5 um  (but that's pigments, not aerosolized droplets)
	nebulizer drops are 1-10 um

	never restrict the outlet of your fan, you overwork the motor
	
http://modelpaint.tripod.com/booth2.htm
http://www.modelersite.com/Abr2003/english/Spray-booth-design_Eng.htm
	sqft of intake * 100 FPM for crossdraft CFM
	fan must be able to deliver that CFM at the static pressure of your ductwork, see chart
		eg 1.98 inh20 for 100' of 4" straight aluminum duct at 200 CFM
		scales linearly, so you can multiply by length of ducts
		flexible duct /triples/ the straight aluminum duct value, it's very restrictive 
		smooth duct angle pieces count for 10x-20x their length
		furnace filters are pretty minimal SP loss
-->	static pressure is CRITICAL
		eg 320 CFM (0.0" SP) drops to only 50 CFM at 0.5" SP!!!!
	bathroom fans are a bad choice, safetywise, as solvents can unvarnish motor windings
	dayton from granger are much better but not explosion proof
	
	plenum space between fans and filters evens out airflow across filters	
		venting the plenum allows for reduction in booth airflow (if e.g. oversized fan)
	24" wide x 19" deep x 17" tall
		top of booth only 10" deep
		2.5" of depth goes to plenum
	double-hinged door (so it folds in center) allows closing booth for dustproof drying
-->	design blueprints http://www.modelersite.com/Abr2003/images/SprayBooth/SprayBooth.jpg
	
http://cs.trains.com/mrr/f/11/t/216975.aspx
	bilge blowers are 'hazardous area' fans that are cheap and safe!
	their whole job is venting diesel fuel fumes, totally ignition-protected
	not designed for continuous use, which is totally ok
	CFM such that you have 100 ft/min (.5m/s) velocity at open side of hood, for a 2 sqft opening that's 200 cfm
		C > 100*A + 4L
		L = length of exhaust duct (feet)
		A = intake aperture (square feet)
		C = rated CFM of blower
		
	filter's job is to keep paint particulates/droplets out of the vent
	vent's job it to carry the solvents outside

20" wide is appropriate
12" tall is appropriate

common furnace filter sizes are 12x12, 12x24, 14x20, 14x24, 14x25, 16x20, 16x25, 18x24, 20x20, 20x24, 20x25

exhaust pipe runs
	4' up
	right angle (6' for 4" duct, or 9' for 5")
	7' north
	right angle (6' for 4" duct, or 9' for 5")
	15' west
equivalent to 38' of straight 4" duct
equivalent to 44' of straight 5" duct

	siting at corner instead reduces it to
	4' up
	right angle
	10' west
equivalent to 20' of 4" or to 23' of 5"


compact booth
	make booth 20" wide, 14" tall = 1.94 sq ft
	
	200 CFM is 1.98inW per 100' of 4" duct
	
	20'/4"	200 CFM @ 20/100*1.98 = .40inW 		good
	38'/4"	200 CFM @ 38/100*1.98 = .75inW 		marginal
	
	can use the $27+$9 attwood bilge blower	(195 cfm @ 0.8inW)


oversized booth
	so make booth 25" wide, 18" tall, use a 16x25 filter and can cut down a 20x25 arrestor
	16x25 filter is 2.78 sq ft, ie 278 cfm minimum before ductwork

	table is 48x23.5

	300 cfm is 4.19inW per 100' of 4" duct
	300 cfm is 1.39inW per 100' of 5" duct

	20'/4"	300 CFM @ 20/100*4.19 = .84inW, 	marginal
	23'/5"	300 CFM @ 23/100*1.39 = 0.31inW 	good
	38'/4"	300 CFM @ 38/100*4.19 = 1.6inW	 	very bad
	44'/5"	300 CFM @ 44/100*1.39 = 0.6inW 		ok
	
	needs the $167 dayton squirrel cage blower (360 cfm @ .8inW)
	maybe can use two bilge blower in parallel, $101 after transformers and wye (195*1.67=325 cfm @ .8inW)
